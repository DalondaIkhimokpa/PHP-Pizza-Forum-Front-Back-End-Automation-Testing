What the Tests Do
The tests are organized into several files:

1.DatabaseTest.php: Tests that your database connection works and that the required tables exist.
2.PizzaTest.php: Tests CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for pizzas:
Creating a new pizza
Searching for pizzas
Deleting pizzas
3.ValidationTest.php: Tests input validation:
Email validation
Title validation (letters and spaces only)
4.Ingredients validation (comma-separated list)
IntegrationTest.php: Tests the full workflow:
Creating a pizza
Retrieving it
Searching for it
Deleting it
Verifying deletion

Important Notes
1.Database Configuration: The tests use the same database connection as your application. Make sure your database is set up correctly before running the tests.
2.Test Data: The tests will create and delete test data in your database. They're designed to clean up after themselves, but be aware that they will modify your database.
3.PHPUnit Version: The tests are written for PHPUnit 11.3. If you use a different version, you might need to adjust the tests.
4.Test Environment: The tests assume a local development environment. If you're running in a different environment, you might need to adjust the database connection parameters in the test files.
